# FCC Report Output Format v4.1

## Clean, Readable Layout

The Synthesizer MUST produce reports in this exact format. This is the canonical v4.1 output structure.

## Structure

```json
{
  "mode": "<mode>",
  "question": "<original question>",

  }
}
```

## Format Rules

1. **Summary**: 2-4 sentences max. Clear thesis. No "probably", "maybe", "might".
2. **Findings**: 5-15 findings minimum. Each must have evidence with file paths.
3. **Recommendations**: All must have founderFeasibilityScore and visionAlignmentScore.
4. **No verbose rambling**: Professional engineering style.
5. **No AI tone**: Write like a technical consultant.
6. **Evidence-based**: Every claim must have evidence.

## Display Format (for UI rendering)

The UI can format the JSON into the clean layout shown in the prompt, but the underlying JSON structure remains as above.
